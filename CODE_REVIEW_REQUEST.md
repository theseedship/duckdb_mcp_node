# üîç Full Code Review Request for DuckDB MCP Native

## Overview

This document triggers a comprehensive code review of the entire DuckDB MCP Native codebase.

## Review Scope

### Core Components to Review

#### 1. **Federation System** (`src/federation/`)

- QueryRouter: Distributed query planning and execution
- ConnectionPool: Connection management and pooling
- ResourceRegistry: Resource discovery and namespace management
- FederationManager: Orchestration layer

#### 2. **Virtual Filesystem** (`src/filesystem/`)

- VirtualFilesystem: Main orchestrator for mcp:// protocol
- CacheManager: Local caching with TTL
- FormatDetector: Auto-detection of data formats
- QueryPreprocessor: SQL transformation

#### 3. **MCP Server** (`src/server/`)

- DuckDBMCPServer: Main server implementation
- 26 MCP tools implementation
- Transport handling (stdio, WebSocket, TCP)

#### 4. **DuckDB Service** (`src/duckdb/`)

- Query execution and security
- Connection pooling
- Memory management

#### 5. **Monitoring** (`src/monitoring/`)

- MetricsCollector: Performance tracking
- Query performance monitoring
- Memory usage tracking

## Key Areas for Review

### Security Concerns

- [ ] SQL injection prevention in federated queries
- [ ] Authentication/authorization in attach_mcp
- [ ] Path traversal in Virtual Filesystem
- [ ] Secrets exposure in logs
- [ ] Input validation across all tools

### Performance Issues

- [ ] Query optimization in federation
- [ ] Connection pool efficiency
- [ ] Cache hit rates and TTL strategies
- [ ] Memory usage in large result sets
- [ ] Async/await patterns

### Architecture Review

- [ ] Separation of concerns
- [ ] Coupling between modules
- [ ] Error handling patterns
- [ ] Dependency injection
- [ ] SOLID principles compliance

### Code Quality

- [ ] TypeScript type safety
- [ ] Error handling consistency
- [ ] Test coverage (~70% currently)
- [ ] Documentation completeness
- [ ] Dead code detection

### Best Practices

- [ ] MCP protocol compliance
- [ ] DuckDB best practices
- [ ] Node.js patterns
- [ ] Async patterns
- [ ] Resource cleanup

## Specific Questions for Review

1. **Federation Security**: Is the federation system properly isolating queries between different MCP servers?

2. **Virtual Filesystem**: Are there any security vulnerabilities in the mcp:// protocol implementation?

3. **Connection Pooling**: Is the connection pool properly handling connection failures and reconnections?

4. **Memory Management**: Are we properly cleaning up resources, especially in the federation components?

5. **Error Propagation**: Are errors being properly caught and propagated through the MCP protocol?

6. **Type Safety**: Are there any TypeScript `any` types that could be more specific?

7. **Test Coverage**: Which critical paths need more test coverage?

8. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Are there any obvious performance issues in the query routing?

## Files Changed (Forcing Full Review)

To trigger comprehensive analysis, this PR touches key files across all modules:

- Federation components
- Virtual Filesystem
- MCP Server
- DuckDB Service
- Monitoring system

## Review Request

@greptile Please perform a FULL CODEBASE REVIEW including:

1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Performance bottlenecks
3. Architecture issues
4. Code quality problems
5. Best practice violations

Focus especially on the federation and virtual filesystem implementations as these are new features.

## Expected Outcome

We expect Greptile to:

- Analyze the entire `src/` directory
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Identify security vulnerabilities
- Suggest performance improvements
- Recommend architectural changes
- Point out code quality issues
